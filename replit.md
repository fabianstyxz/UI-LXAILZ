# Replit.md

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Roblox UI Library that completely replicates all Rayfield functionality with a custom modern, dark, minimalist design. The library is built with Lua and features a fully modular architecture compatible with loadstring() execution.

## System Architecture

**Current State**: Complete modular UI library with modern glitch-effect design for Roblox.

**Architecture Components**:
- **Main.lua**: Entry point and library initialization
- **Modules/**: Organized component system with individual modules
- **Utils.lua**: Utility functions and compatibility layer
- **Theme.lua**: Comprehensive theming system
- **Component System**: All interactive UI elements (Toggle, Slider, Button, etc.)
- **Advanced Systems**: Notifications, KeySystem, LoadingScreen, ConfigManager

## Key Components

**Implemented Components**:
1. **Window System**: CreateWindow with loading screens and configuration
2. **Tab System**: CreateTab with navigation and organization
3. **Interactive Components**: 
   - CreateToggle: Toggle switches with callbacks
   - CreateSlider: Value sliders with min/max ranges
   - CreateButton: Interactive buttons with ripple effects
   - CreateInput: Text input fields with validation
   - CreateDropdown: Single/multi-select dropdowns
   - CreateColorPicker: Full HSV color picker
   - CreateKeybind: Key binding with hold mode support
   - CreateParagraph: Rich text paragraphs
   - CreateLabel: Simple text labels
   - CreateDivider: Section dividers
4. **Notification System**: Animated notifications with multiple types
5. **Key System**: Complete key verification with Discord integration
6. **Loading Screen**: Animated loading with typewriter effects
7. **Config Manager**: JSON-based configuration saving/loading
8. **Discord Prompt**: Modal invitation system
9. **Floating Button**: Draggable mobile-compatible button
10. **Theme System**: Multiple themes (Dark, Light, Neon) with custom creation

## Data Flow

**Current Implementation**:
1. Library initialization loads all modules
2. CreateWindow establishes main UI container
3. CreateTab creates navigation and content areas
4. Component creation adds interactive elements
5. Callback system handles user interactions
6. Theme system manages consistent styling
7. Advanced systems provide enhanced functionality

## External Dependencies

**Roblox Services Required**:
- TweenService: For smooth animations
- UserInputService: For input handling and platform detection
- RunService: For frame-based operations
- HttpService: For key validation and configuration
- TextService: For text size calculations
- GuiService: For UI management
- Players: For player-specific functionality

## Deployment Strategy

**Current Strategy**: 
- **Development**: Local Lua testing environment with mock services
- **Production**: Direct deployment to Roblox via loadstring()
- **Distribution**: Single-file execution or modular loading
- **Compatibility**: Full Rayfield API compatibility for easy migration
